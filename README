Prerequisites
--------------

   This library needs following pre-requisites

   * CURL (http://curl.haxx.se/)

   * OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/)


Authentication with AWS
----------------------

AWS4C uses ~/.awsAuth file for retrieving AWS credentials the .awsAuth
has the format similar to UNIX passwd file.  Each line of the file
should contain the following items,  user ID,  AWS Key ID, and AWS Key.
The items should be separated by colon ':'.   The first item of each line
the user ID parameter is a record identifier.  The record identifeir is
used by aws_read_config function to the AWS key  id and the value to be used 
by the library.  The sample code supplied with this library uses ID 'sample'
Make sure to configure this ID in your .awsAuth file before running the 
example programs.

Note the .awsAuth file should be owned by the user who is executing the 
program and should have permissons such that it is only readable by the
owner.
 
Here is an example of the file:

id:1XASDSDSDSAMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE
user2:1X35D84SD9AMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE
sample:1XA39S3xwSAMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE


Installation
------------

    Make sure that pre-requisites installed.  Then run 'make' command to
    build examples.

    Edit the ~/.awsAuth file.  Put the your AWS key for the sample ID

    Run the following examples to test the library

	sqs_example   --  shows SQS interface
	s3_put	      --  puts a file into S3
	s3_get	      --  retrieves the file from S3


Integration
-----------

    To integrate the library with your project copy aws4c.c and aws4c.h
    into your project directory and edit your makefile accordingly

    Refer to Makefile supplied with the library for guidance
